## Architecture

### State Management
The application uses Zustand for state management with the following stores:

- **Time Store** (`/src/store/timeStore.ts`) - Global time management for animations

### Component Structure

### Dungeon Generation
The dungeon generation system uses:
- **Hex Grid Layout** - Six-sided tile system for interesting geometry
- **Procedural Algorithms** - Randomized layout with guaranteed connectivity
- **Smart Wall System** - Automatic wall placement with doorway detection between rooms/corridors
- **Connection-Based Logic** - Walls only appear where hexes are not connected
- **Texture Mapping** - Seamless texture application to generated geometry
- **Performance Culling** - Only visible hexes within render distance are processed

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false` - Disables source maps for production builds

### Shader Configuration
The terminal effect shader supports time-based color cycling:
- **80-second cycle**: 30s green â†’ 10s transition â†’ 30s purple â†’ 10s transition
- **Time-synchronized**: Connected to global time store for consistent animation
- **WebGL optimized**: Efficient shader uniforms with minimal CPU overhead

### Texture Assets
Textures are located in `/public/textures/`:
- `floor-texture.png` - Dungeon floor tiling
- `wall-texture.png` - Wall surface textures  
- `ceiling-texture.png` - Overhead ceiling textures

## Performance

### Optimization Features
- **Memoized Components** - Prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Hex Map Caching** - Pre-built neighbor lookup maps for efficient wall generation
- **Distance-based Culling** - Only render hexes within 300 unit radius
- **Chunked Updates** - Visibility recalculation every ~2 hex movement
- **WebGL Optimizations** - High-performance context with disabled antialiasing/shadows
- **Collision Optimization** - Efficient circle-to-box collision detection with nearby hex filtering

### Performance Notes
- **30 FPS Cap** - Some systems may be limited to 30fps due to VSync/power management
- **Chrome vs Firefox** - Chrome may exhibit more movement hitching at 30fps than Firefox
- **GPU Acceleration** - Requires discrete GPU for optimal performance
- **Render Distance** - 300 units with ~1000 hex capacity

### Target Performance
- **60 FPS** on modern desktop browsers (when system allows)
- **30 FPS** baseline with smooth movement compensation
- **< 2MB** initial bundle size

## Browser Support

- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
